[00:19.46] Come a little bit closer
[00:23.98] Hear what I have to say
[00:35.48] 
[00:36.39] Just like children sleepin'
[00:40.77] We could dream this night away
[00:55.77] 
[00:53.10] But there's a full moon risin'
[00:57.33] Let's go dancin' in the light
[01:11.83] 
[01:10.01] We know where the music's playin'
[01:14.21] Let's go out and feel the night
[01:29.71] 
[01:26.98] Because I'm still in love with you
[01:31.70] I wanna see you dance again
[01:35.75] Because I'm still in love with you
[01:40.75] On this harvest moon
[01:50.75] 
[02:01.75] When we were strangers
[02:05.95] I watched you from afar
[02:17.45] 
[02:18.88] When we were lovers
[02:22.93] I loved you with all my heart
[02:37.43] 
[02:35.12] But now it's gettin' late
[02:39.44] And the moon is climbin' high
[02:53.94] 
[02:51.68] I want to celebrate
[02:56.13] See it shinin' in your eye
[03:09.13] 
[03:08.90] Because I'm still in love with you
[03:13.42] I wanna see you dance again
[03:17.53] Because I'm still in love with you
[03:22.38] On this harvest moon
[03:32.38] 
[04:16.27] Because I'm still in love with you
[04:21.05] I wanna see you dance again
[04:24.79] Because I'm still in love with you
[04:29.73] On this harvest moon

The moon is full and my heart is high
I love to dance, oh me, oh my
Gonna have more fun than a tree in a coon
Tonight's the dance of the cajun moon

Pick ups and wagons 'round the river road shack
Bonfires draw in a crowd out back
Step through the door and I see my cherie
That's when I feel her mama's eyes on me

Cajun moon, nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain to a love in bloom, so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon

Guitar, a squeeze box, a fiddle, and bow
Little band playin' every song they know
Old woman sittin' there and yellin' for more
My heart is willin', but my feet, they're so sore

Cajun moon, nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain to a love in bloom, so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon

Once more we're waltzin' to Jolie Blond
I lean in closer and cheri responds
Her mama's smilin' as we slip from the room
To sit and stare at the cajun moon.

Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon...

Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon...
